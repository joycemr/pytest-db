# Ignore everything in this directory
# it is just for rolled up build artifacts

# Except this file
# !.gitignore

# normally you would have a .gitignore file like above, with lines 3 and 5 above not
# commented out to not save build artifacts to the repo,
# but this template uses a simplified SQL DDL file
# that is coded directly here to build the test database.
